# Angular Demo Project Plan: Video Game Store

## High-Level Project Description

This project is a demo Angular application developed as part of the Quantexa onboarding process. It implements a video game store that demonstrates Angular core concepts, state management, UI libraries, and modern best practices.

The application allows users to:
- Search for games
- View paginated results
- See detailed information in a game details page
- Add games to a cart
- Complete a checkout form
- Generate a downloadable PDF order summary during checkout

The app integrates Angular concepts from both Quantexa team requirements and the Angular Essentials course by Academind (Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller). It is built using Angular with a modular architecture, PrimeNG for UI components, NgRx for state management, Signals for reactive state, RxJS for async operations, and Reactive Forms for user input.

## Angular Features & Core Concepts Demonstrated

- **Component Communication:** `@Input()` and `@Output()`
- **State Management:** NgRx for global state, Signals for reactive state
- **Async Data Handling:** Observables and RxJS operators
- **UI Components:** PrimeNG (table, paginator, overlay panel, form inputs)
- **Architecture:** Lazy-loaded feature modules, Shared/Core modules
- **Forms:** Reactive Forms with sync and async validation
- **Customization:** Custom Directives and Pipes (alongside built-in)
- **Dependency Injection:** Services and Http Interceptors
- **Lifecycle:** Lifecycle hooks (`OnInit`, `OnDestroy`, etc.)
- **Performance:** Change Detection strategy (`OnPush`)
- **PDF Generation:** External library (jsPDF or pdfMake)
